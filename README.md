# pseudo3d

A small demonstration of a 3D-like effect made possible by jQuery. Unlicensed because I'm sure many people have done the same in the past; my aim is simply to make it easily accessible.<br>
Comments are strewn throughout the code that document the purpose of each code block and how it contributes to the overall effect.
Works best with a square-shaped window.
